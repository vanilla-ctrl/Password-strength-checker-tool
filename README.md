# Password-strength-checker-tool
Simple yet useful tool for cybersecurity professionals to educate users or test the strength of passwords. Try entering different passwords to see how the strength meter and suggestions change.

**How It Works:**

    The user enters a password in the input field.

    JavaScript checks the password against various criteria (length, complexity, etc.).

    The strength meter updates dynamically based on the password's strength.

    Suggestions are displayed to help the user improve their password.
